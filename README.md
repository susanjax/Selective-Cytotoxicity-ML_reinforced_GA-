# Selective-Cytotoxicity-ML_reinforced_GA

The use of nanomaterials, particles with size less than 100nm, are increasing used in food processing, cosmetics and medical applications. This raise the concern of toxicity of nanoparticles in human health and to address these issues researchers are developing predictive models to predict the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles. Eventhough these developed models could predict cytotoxicity of nanomaterials it still fail to address one of the key issue, selectivity of the nanoparticle. NMs are considered to be non-selective and treated as passive carriers, where additional functionalities are given through additional chemical modifications. However, these modifications not only make the system more complex hindering its clinical translation, but also change its behavior in the living organisms in unpredictable ways altering therapeutic action of the delivered drug molecules. At the same time, despite metabolic differences between healthy and pathological cells, there are no pipelines for automatic computational design of selective NMs. In this work we for the first time propose a powerful and fully computational screening approach to massive targeted discovery of selectively cytotoxic inorganic NMs.
